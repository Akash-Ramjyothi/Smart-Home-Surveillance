<h1 align="center">Advanced Eye Tracking</h1>

## 📜 Description:
Developed an advanced eye-tracking system with OpenCV and data extracted from a recorded .flv file. The program bounds the box of the iris and scales on the axis. The Eye-Tracking can be used in Surveillance to see if the user is seeing a screen such as TV or not. If the user is not seeing the screen, it can show up a message that User is inactive. In further scaling, it can also be used to monitor workload of a user doing a particular task.
